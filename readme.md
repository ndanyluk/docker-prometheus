**ndanyluk/docker-prometheus |** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ndanyluk/docker-prometheus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ndanyluk/docker-prometheus)

This repository is my home for docker images based on prometheus.io's Prometheus software.  This repo packages the binary file with a configuration folder found in stefanprodan's swarmprom repo and creates a multi-arch image.
